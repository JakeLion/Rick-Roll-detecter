# Rick-Roll-detecter
This is the ultimate system to detect rick roll links, just enter your link and our database will be searched!

## Versions and libraries
This uses no libraries or modules at this time. 
Python version: 3.9.2

## Contribution
We are always open to accepting new Rick Rolls links of any kind in order to improve the software. If this project ends up going anywhere, I will work on development of a UI to make it easier for the common person (or windows users) to use.

## About
This software compares the link entered by the user to known "rick rolls", if the link matches it warnes the user, otherwise it informs the user that the link is safe.
The software is designed to allow the user to check multiple links without restarting the software.
